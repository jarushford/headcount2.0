# HeadCount 2.0

### Abstract 

The goal of this project was to use a series of provided data sets to create an app where you can view and compare different statistics for school districts in Colorado. The first step was to create a helper class to clean up the provided data so that it would be more easily utilized in the components created for the app. The main technical focus of the project was fully testing the app using Jest and Enzyme, as well as continuing to work on writing clean, modular React components.
